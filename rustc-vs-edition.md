# **Difference Between Rust Edition and Compiler Version**

Rust has a unique versioning model that includes **Editions** and **Compiler Versions**. While they may seem similar, they serve different purposes.

---

## **1. Rust Compiler Version (`rustc`)**

### **What is it?**
- The compiler version (`rustc --version`) represents the specific release of the Rust compiler.
- Follows **semantic versioning** (e.g., `1.75.0`, `1.76.0`).
- New versions are released **every six weeks** with bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.

### **Example:**
```sh
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.75.0 (2024-01-04)
```
- This means you are using Rust **compiler version 1.75.0**, released on Jan 4, 2024.

### **Why does it matter?**
- Determines **which language features are available**.
- Ensures you are using an **up-to-date** compiler with the latest optimizations.
- Can still compile **older Rust Editions** unless features are explicitly deprecated.

---

## **2. Rust Edition**

### **What is it?**
- An **Edition** is a major release that introduces **breaking changes** in a **controlled way**.
- Editions are released **every few years** (`2015`, `2018`, `2021`, `2024`).
- Rust compiler supports **multiple editions** to ensure **backward compatibility**.

### **Example:**
Your `Cargo.toml` file specifies the edition:
```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```
This means the project follows Rust **2021 Edition rules**, even if compiled with Rust **1.75.0** or later.

### **Why does it matter?**
- Controls **how Rust code is interpreted** (e.g., module system changes, keyword updates).
- Enables **new language features** while keeping older code functional.
- Allows teams to **gradually migrate** rather than breaking code with every new compiler update.

## **Key Differences:**

| Feature            | Rust Compiler Version (`rustc`) | Rust Edition |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **Definition**     | Version of the Rust compiler  | Major language milestone |
| **Release Cycle**  | Every **6 weeks** | Every **few years** |
| **Versioning**     | Semantic (`1.75.0`, `1.76.0`, etc.) | Named (`2015`, `2018`, `2021`, `2024`) |
| **Purpose**        | Introduces **incremental** changes & optimizations | Introduces **breaking** language updates in a controlled way |
| **Specified In**   | `rustc --version` | `Cargo.toml` (`edition = "2021"`) |
| **Backwards Compatibility** | New compiler can compile older editions | Can use old editions, but new features might be unavailable |

---

## **Example Scenario**
Let's say you have Rust **1.75.0** installed but your project uses Rust **2018 Edition** (`edition = "2018"` in `Cargo.toml`).

‚úÖ You can still **compile and run** the code.
‚úÖ If you upgrade to **Rust 1.76.0**, the project still works **without changes**.
‚ùå But **new 2021 or 2024 Edition features won‚Äôt be available** until you update the edition.

---

## **When to Upgrade?**
- **Update Rust Compiler** (`rustup update`) to get **performance improvements** and bug fixes.
- **Upgrade Edition** (in `Cargo.toml`) if you want **modern Rust features** but may need minor code adjustments.
